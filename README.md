# InternetSpeedTest
Python program that tests internet speed and logs results in a text file.

I wanted to test the Carlaw internet speed whithout a fibre link  and now with the fibre connection.

Data is collected for the first collection.

Need to collect data with the new fibre link.


A new program will be created to extract and read the data from the text file.
