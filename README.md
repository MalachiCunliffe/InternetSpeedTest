# InternetSpeedTest
Python script that tests internet speed and logs results in a text file.

I wanted to test the Carlaw internet speed without a fibre link and again once the fibre connection was installed.

Data is collected for the first collection.

Need to collect data with the new fibre link.

A new script will be created to extract and read the data from the text file.

TODO:

(x) Update data to NZST as all dates UTC

(x) Run script for a week to gather data.

(x) Compare data and create data visualizations
